# Sorting-Algorithms
The program generates a random array of user specification and allows choice of sorting algorithms: insertion, quick, heap, merge, and bubble. Time is displayed at the end of the sorting process iteration. 

# Key Features:
Multiple Sorting Algorithms: Implements a variety of sorting methods, including Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Shell Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. Each algorithm is executed and timed to provide insights into its efficiency.

Dynamic Array Generation: Users can generate random arrays of integers of specified sizes and ranges, offering flexibility in testing the sorting algorithms with different datasets.

Real-time Performance Analysis: Each sorting operation is timed in nanoseconds, allowing users to compare the performance of different sorting algorithms under various conditions.

User-Friendly Interface: The application prompts users to select an algorithm and provides clear instructions and outputs. Invalid inputs are gracefully handled to guide the user back to valid choices.

Educational Value: Ideal for students and developers looking to understand and compare the implementation and efficiency of different sorting techniques in Java.

# Technical Implementation:
Developed in Java, showcasing object-oriented programming principles.
Utilizes the Scanner class for input and the Arrays class for array manipulations.
Offers a practical application of data structures and algorithms in a user-interactive format.
Usage:
Running the Application: Compile and run the JavaSortTest class. Follow the on-screen prompts to choose a sorting algorithm or to generate a new array.
Viewing Sorting in Action: After selecting a sorting method, the program displays each pass of the sorting algorithm, allowing users to visualize the sorting process.
Performance Metrics: The application displays the time taken by each sorting algorithm, providing a practical comparison of their efficiencies.
